Some notes:

# EMA (Exponential Moving Average):
This is the mathematical method used to calculate the acceptable_price.
Instead of a simple average (where all prices count equally), an EMA gives more importance or 
weight to the most recent prices. Market prices jump around. A simple average changes slowly. 
The last price can be random noise.
An EMA tries to find a balance â€“ it smooths out the noise like an average but reacts faster 
to real changes than a simple average.

# ALPHA:
This is the control knob for the EMA calculation. It's a number between 0 and 1 (here it's 0.3).
It determines how much weight the EMA gives to the very latest mid_price.
ALPHA = 0.3 means 30% weight on the new price, 70% on the previous EMA value.
A higher ALPHA makes the EMA react faster to price changes (less smoothing). 
A lower ALPHA makes it react slower (more smoothing).
